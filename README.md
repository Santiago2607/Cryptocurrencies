# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to be able to show new trends good enough to convince people of the worth of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and more. In order to perform this new task, we are going to use a new technique that helps us find all the answers we need to demonstrate the value of cryptocurrencies. If you have not guessed yet, I am talking about unsupervised machine learning.

## Results

After doing some analysis using unsupervised machine learning, we were able to gather the following information according to the dataset we received. 

1. In this first picture, we can see the graph of the elbow curve where we determined the rate and value of the cryptocurrencies.

## Summary

With all the information we were able to collect from the analysis, we can conclude that cryptocurrencies are without a doubt a great investment sector whose earnings are made for the long term and that in more than one way they encourage the principles and use of digital money.
